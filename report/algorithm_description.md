# Algorithm Descriptions and Implementation Details

## 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

### 1.1 Overview and Working Principle
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm that makes predictions based on the majority class among the k most similar training examples. The algorithm's simplicity and effectiveness make it a popular choice for classification tasks, especially in image recognition problems like MNIST digit classification.

The KNN algorithm operates on the fundamental principle of similarity-based classification. When presented with a new, unlabeled data point, the algorithm:
1. Calculates distances to all training samples
2. Identifies the k closest neighbors
3. Uses majority voting among these neighbors to determine the class

Key advantages of KNN include:
- Non-parametric nature (no assumptions about data distribution)
- Adaptability to complex decision boundaries
- Naturally handles multi-class problems
- Zero training time (lazy learning)

### 1.2 Mathematical Foundation

#### 1.2.1 Feature Vector Representation
For MNIST images, each 28×28 pixel image is converted into a 784-dimensional feature vector:
\[
x = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_{784}] \in \mathbb{R}^{784}
\]
where each \(x_i\) represents a normalized pixel value in the range [0,1].

#### 1.2.2 Distance Metrics
The algorithm uses Euclidean distance to measure similarity between feature vectors:

\[
d(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{784} (x_i - y_i)^2}
\]

Alternative distance metrics considered:
1. Manhattan Distance:
\[
d_{manhattan}(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^{784} |x_i - y_i|
\]

2. Minkowski Distance (general form):
\[
d_{minkowski}(x, y) = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{784} |x_i - y_i|^p\right)^{1/p}
\]

#### 1.2.3 Classification Rule
The predicted class \(\hat{y}\) for a test instance x is determined by majority voting:

\[
\hat{y} = \arg\max_{c} \sum_{i=1}^{k} I(y_i = c)
\]

where:
- c ∈ {0,1,...,9} represents the digit class
- I() is the indicator function
- k is the number of nearest neighbors

#### 1.2.4 Distance Metric Selection Criteria
The choice of distance metric significantly impacts performance:

1. **Euclidean Distance**: Optimal for continuous variables with similar scales
   - Advantages: Intuitive, rotation-invariant
   - Disadvantages: Sensitive to feature scaling

2. **Manhattan Distance**: Preferred for high-dimensional spaces
   - Advantages: Computationally efficient, robust to outliers
   - Disadvantages: Not rotation-invariant

3. **Minkowski Distance**: Generalizes both previous metrics
   - p=1: Manhattan Distance
   - p=2: Euclidean Distance
   - p→∞: Chebyshev Distance

#### 1.2.5 Weighted Voting Schemes
Beyond simple majority voting, weighted schemes can be implemented:

\[
\hat{y} = \arg\max_{c} \sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i \cdot I(y_i = c)
\]

where \(w_i\) is the weight of the i-th neighbor, typically:
\[
w_i = \frac{1}{d(x, x_i)^2}
\]
